# NameQuizApp
This application is a naming quiz where you guess the name of the person (animal) on the picture.

# Some notes:
1. Long click on the picture will delete
2. Haven't added naming pictures that gets externally added, works nevertheless. But it tells if it is from gallery or camera.
3. DatabaseActivity is slow and i havent figured out why.
4. Pixel 5 is used as AVD.
5. Need to take a picture and restart the app before you can add picture from the gallery at first time initialization.
